Hi,
I am a constant user of Spotify and I was was looking through the MLconf website when I came across Erik Bernhardsson as one of the speakers in last year's conference in New York City. I immediately searched for Machine Learning jobs at Spotify and was delighted to discover a position I am interested in.
Spotify is a dream company for me and would I love to come into the office just to get a chance to interview. I am currently a student at NYU doing my Master's in Informatics. I will be graduating in August and am looking for a full time opportunity. I will be working for Buzzfeed over the summer and I can come over anytime since I am living in Brooklyn, New York.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration and hope to hear from you soon!
